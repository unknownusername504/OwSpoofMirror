TLDR:
Run AntiFlag as admin when you swap between accounts, save password to browser profile that has your passwords aka your chrome/gmail acct login.

Note:
Don't run random internet files, I can't say these wont get passed around modified. These are OS level calls and can easily fuck your shit up. Just going out of date might cause issues (3/24/23 - d/m/y). If a program doesn't require the internet, turn airplane mode on. Set your personal folders as protected and back them up. Scan files, I use the chrome scanner that comes with premium membership. Anyways ...

Instructions:
Save your passwords, namely if you use chrome password book save your chrome password. These will clear browser cookies. Browser cookies are trackers and despite the name can be used in apps, like to log into OW. Run all these as admin aka 1 left click > right click (more options if needed) > run as admin. AntiFlag is enough, the other ones currently are not known to be required. AntiFlag clearing browsercookies means your battlenet app login prefill will be blank, you will also have to clear all apps to run through firewall again (network access popup). You do not have to close anything manually, you do not have to restart for AntiFlag. You do not have to uninstall/reinstall anything (It will auto relocate your games though). Run this anytime you get an acct warning pop up or anytime you swap between accounts (or you will be chain banned). Your PC will have flags that will mark other accounts especially in the case of acct sharing/buying but once these accounts are marked they will send that off to the servers where they build a map of all the accounts with your flags. You can request your data and see this.

The IdChangers require restarts and will change how your device appears to software. Save whatever you chamge. Also the HWID you increment the number in hex. Same with MAC Id they only the pc renamer auto changes things. You can also just rename your pc in windows go to search and type PC Name then add a random number to the end or something. You only need to do this if in the future things change and they have better ID methods and only if you get banned within a day on new accounts. The PC rename also should be enough, easiest to run and the least intrusive.

The cookie file is an exploit blizz has had for years, leaks countless accounts including your info and payment. And yet they require you to use your real name if you want support :clown_emoji: If you don't have a cookie or know what that is then don't worry about it but it allows you to backdoor login to any cracked accounts. Anyone's account can be cracked. You can also use cookies to log in through the browser and just change the info. Including mostly to scare people into not trusting blizz and not leaving personal info on their acct.
